## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Fixed price format (removed **₹ symbol**, handled missing values).  
- Standardized **product names, categories, and sizes**.  
- Converted **quantities/sizes** into **consistent units** (where possible).  
- Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python & Excel)
- **Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly):**  
  - Price distributions across categories and brands.  
  - Grouped bar charts, box plots, violin plots.  
  - Correlation heatmaps for numeric features.
    
### 3️⃣ Statistical Analysis
- **T-Test:** Compare average price of **branded vs. unbranded products**.  
- **ANOVA:** Price variation across multiple categories.  
- **Chi-square:** Association between categories and price ranges.  
- Summary statistics: **Mean, Median, Standard Deviation by category**.  

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis
- Grouped by **category and brand** to calculate **average prices**.  
- Used **subqueries** to find **top 5 expensive items per category**.  
- Applied **window functions** for ranking products and running averages.
